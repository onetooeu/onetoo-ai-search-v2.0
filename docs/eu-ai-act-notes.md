# EU AI Act notes (non-legal, operational)

This project is an infrastructure pattern for trust-first data discovery.
To stay sane for a decade:
- log provenance (proof bundles)
- keep audit trails (append-only pending log, signed accepted sets)
- document governance (roles, key rotation, incident response)
- support human review for stable lane changes
- publish transparency artifacts (accepted-set versions, release notes)

Not legal advice.
